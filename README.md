# AutomationExercise

## Instructions to use the skeleton solution.

1. Use Visual Studio, C# and Specflow to complete the exercise. SpecRun is used in the solution as the test runner.
2. Fork the solution (Do not branch). Sign up for a free public GitHub account (or you can use an exsiting account if you already have a one). Commit your implimentation and send us the link to your repository.
3. Automate the happy path (positive scenarios) to create a google account. Automate the scenario in such a way that, its easy to extend and reuse your code in future.
4. Use Chrome as the browser. 
5. You can suggest improvements to the sample project provided when you are sharing the completed exercise. Clearly mention any assumptions made during your implementation.
6. Make sure the solution can be built and tests can be executed successfully before you commit.

Thank you for taking time to complete the exercise and Good Luck!
